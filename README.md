# OpenCV-Raspberry-Pi-Projects
These are the files I've submitted for a Computer Vision class I took back in Spring 2017. If you are in a computer vision class, please note the following: 

1. These were built on a Raspberry Pi. In the OpenCV-RaspberryPi folder, there will be a .txt explaining how to install the prerequisite libraries and how to run the example programs. 

2. I only uploaded my work to github so that I can show potential employers what I've done with Raspberry Pi, OpenCV, and Python. It does not reflect on my current level of skill and I may decide to go back and redo these old assignments at a later date. 

3. Do not submit this as your own work. It's not worth getting caught and you're not learning anything by copying someone else's work.
