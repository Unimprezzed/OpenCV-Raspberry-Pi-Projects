# OpenCV-Raspberry-Pi-Projects
These are the files I've submitted for a Computer Vision class I took back in Spring 2017. If you are in a computer vision class, please note the following: 

1. These were built on a Raspberry Pi. In the OpenCV-RaspberryPi folder, there will be a .txt explaining how to install the prerequisite libraries and how to run the example programs. 

2. Do not submit this as your own work. It's not worth getting caught and you're not learning anything by copying someone else's work.
